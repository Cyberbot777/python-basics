# Python Learning
This repository tracks my journey to becoming a junior Python AI/ML developer.
- **File:** `data_structures.py` - Practice with dictionaries and lists to calculate student grade averages.
- **File:** `student_manager.py` - Enhanced student data management with functions and file I/O.
- **File:** `grade_analyzer.py` - Analyzes student grades using nested loops, while loops, and advanced conditionals.
- **File:** `student_sorter.py` - Implements bubble sort and sorts students by their averages.
- **Progress:** 
  - March 18, 2025: Created `data_structures.py` with multiple student dictionaries, added major, calculated averages, classified grades for all students, added comments, and fixed output formatting.
  - March 19, 2025: Added function to calculate averages, sorted grades in descending order, added pass/fail status, fixed pass/fail logic, improved error handling, enhanced output formatting with rounding, and added docstring.
  - March 20, 2025: Created `student_manager.py` with enhanced function to calculate averages with a passing threshold, added file I/O to save/load student data, and improved error handling for file operations.
  - March 21, 2025: Created `grade_analyzer.py` to analyze student grades using nested loops, while loops for user input, and advanced conditionals for letter grades.
  - March 24, 2025: Created `student_sorter.py` to implement bubble sort and sort students by their averages, with both ascending and descending options.
- **Skills:** Python, Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries), Functions, Error Handling, File I/O, Control Structures, Loops, Algorithms (Sorting)
- **Goals:** Land an entry-level Python AI/ML developer role by December 2025.
