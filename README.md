# Python Learning
This repository tracks my journey to becoming a junior Python AI/ML developer.
- **File:** `data_structures.py` - Practice with dictionaries and lists to calculate student grade averages.
- **File:** `student_sorter.py` - Program to manage student data with file I/O and sorting by average grade.
- **File:** `student_searcher.py` - Program to manage student data with file I/O, search by name, and a menu interface.
- **Progress:** 
  - March 18, 2025: Created `data_structures.py` with multiple student dictionaries, added major, calculated averages, classified grades for all students, added comments, and fixed output formatting.
  - March 19, 2025: Added function to calculate averages, sorted grades in descending order, added pass/fail status, improved error handling, enhanced output formatting, and fixed rounding for all averages in `data_structures.py`.
  - March 20-23, 2025: Reviewed Python concepts including functions, file I/O, and error handling, and practiced with small exercises to prepare for larger projects.
  - March 24, 2025: Created `student_sorter.py` to manage student data, save/load to a file, and sort students by average grade.
  - March 25, 2025: Created `student_searcher.py` to manage student data, save/load to a file, search students by name, fixed bugs in search functionality and file loading, added a menu interface for adding, searching, viewing, removing, and saving students with user confirmation for removal and exit.
  - March 26, 2025: Rearranged menu options in `student_searcher.py` to prioritize viewing all students and reordered add/remove options for better usability, and added grade validation and search by average grade range.
  - March 27, 2025: Enhanced `student_searcher.py` with search by partial name.
- **Skills:** Python, Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries), Functions, File I/O, Error Handling, Sorting, Searching
