# Python Learning
This repository tracks my journey to becoming a junior Python AI/ML developer.
- **File:** `data_structures.py` - Practice with dictionaries and lists to calculate student grade averages.
- **File:** `student_manager.py` - Enhanced student data management with functions and file I/O.
- **Progress:** 
  - March 18, 2025: Created `data_structures.py` with multiple student dictionaries, added major, calculated averages, classified grades for all students, added comments, and fixed output formatting.
  - March 19, 2025: Added function to calculate averages, sorted grades in descending order, added pass/fail status, fixed pass/fail logic, improved error handling, enhanced output formatting with rounding, and added docstring.
  - March 20, 2025: Created `student_manager.py` with enhanced function to calculate averages with a passing threshold, added file I/O to save/load student data, and improved error handling for file operations.
- **Skills:** Python, Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries), Functions, Error Handling, File I/O
- **Goals:** Land an entry-level Python AI/ML developer role by December 2025.
